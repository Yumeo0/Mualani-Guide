## Disclaimer

Using this project should generally be safe. I have read through both
[HoYoverse's response to Script, Plug-In, and Third-Party Software](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/103714)
and the [Terms of Service](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/company/terms).
Neither of those documents forbids the intercepting of network packets if it
does not achieve artificial in-game progress. All data saved by this app is
available to the user of genshin by just playing the game and no additional
requests are made by this software to receive more data from the game servers.
This software also does not in any way shape or form modify the game or interact
with it in any way. And lastly this software does not compete with any of the
companies provided services as there are none that provide the same
functionality. I am not a lawyer though so use this software at your own risk.
